The API client can be initialized as follows:

## Code-Based Client Initialization

```python
from paypalseedpartnerapi.configuration import Environment
from paypalseedpartnerapi.paypalseedpartnerapi_client import PaypalseedpartnerapiClient

client = PaypalseedpartnerapiClient(
    environment=Environment.PRODUCTION
)
```

## Environment-Based Client Initialization

```python
from paypalseedpartnerapi.paypalseedpartnerapi_client import PaypalseedpartnerapiClient

# Specify the path to your .env file if it’s located outside the project’s root directory.
client = PaypalseedpartnerapiClient.from_environment(dotenv_path='/path/to/.env')
```

See the [Environment-Based Client Initialization](../doc/environment-based-client-initialization.md) section for details.
